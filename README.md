# Project Goal
Get rid of the need of office hours and use an AI tutor to help answer your CS 225 questions. 

## Data/AI
The data came from scraping two years of the CS 225 Discord data as well OpenAI API. 

## Outcome
It could answer pretty much any conceptual question but since it wasn't really good at debugging as you'd need to understand the whole codebase as well as many times debugging is very much context and code specific. 

It is cool project but perhaps not the right problem. Perhaps with some small funding, the project could be picked up again with a different class or different use case.
