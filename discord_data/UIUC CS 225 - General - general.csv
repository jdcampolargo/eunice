is it ethical and/or permitted to share test cases with other students? my intuition says no to ethical, but maybe to permitted -- it's not clear to me in the student code

¬ß 1‚Äë402a mentions 
> Instructors are strongly encouraged to make in advance a clear statement of their policies and procedures concerning the use of shared study aids, examination files, and related materials and forms of assistance
¬ß 1‚Äë402a.1 mentions
> Allowing others to conduct research or prepare any work for a student without prior authorization from the Instructor, including using the services of commercial term paper companies.
my intuition says *maybe* it's ""legal"", because test cases are not submitted for a grade -- but it could be considered an unauthorized study aid, perhaps...

do the instructors have a stance on this?
*disclaimer, this is a hypothetical question, of course. i'd just like to have a greater understanding of what professors at UIUC consider as academic integrity violation, so i can stay as *far* away from that as possible :)","",""

For this question, they're asking us to remove an element from the end of the list. 
To do this in O(1) time, we need to be able to access
(1) The final element (to remove it) 
(2) The element before it (to set it's next pointer equal to NULL) without having to traverse through the list at all. 
Out of all the options, only IV gives us access to the final element (tail) and the element before it (tail->prev) without having to traverse through the list, hence (a) is correct.
You should also know the difference between a singly-linked list and a doubly-linked list. A singly-linked list has a next pointer while a doubly-linked list has a next pointer and a prev pointer.","","üëç (1)"

SUHA can be interpreted as saying that the chance that any particular key is inserted at a particular index is (1/N) so if you insert n things in to the table the expected number of items at any index is n/N so that gives a runtime of O(n/N).","","üôå (1)"

Basically, a GPU is a mega parallelized but much slower processor. The reason that's useful is for things like graphics (especially 3d graphics), you need to do a metric crap tonne of matrix multiplications. Even though the GPU isn't ""fast"" compared to a CPU, that amount of matrix multiplications can (relatively) easily be split up among the thousands of cores and run faster overall due to the shear amount of small problems they have to solve","",""

@growthmindset this is something that irks me about the CS department. I understand the priority system and all but the way that they go about it sucks.

The way I do this is strictly visual so this will be wordy to try to explain but, step by step, 
1.  D -> H
2. D has root H, H has size 2 which is greater than C which points to nothing. C -> H
3. B -> A
4. E -> H
5. E has root H, H has size 3. B has root A, A has size 2. Bigger size wins, root of B points to root of E (A -> H)
6. Both C and B point to H, so normally nothing would happen BUT since this has path compression and when we find(B) it recurses up to its root, we set B to point to its root, so now B -> H
7. E and A point to the same root so nothing happens
Now you can write out A B C D E F G H I J and write down what each points to. If root, since we are doing union by size, the value is -1 minus # of nodes pointing at the root, so H will be -6
A, B, C, D, E will all have value of H (7) and the rest will be -1","",""

        1. Click the green button at the bottom left and click `Connect to Host`
        2. Enter `YourNetID@cs225-remote.ews.illinois.edu` and press enter. Enter your password if needed
        3. This will probably not work, so open the VSCode command palette (View --> Command Palette) at the top
        4. Type `remote` in to the box, but do not press enter yet
        5. Select `Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host` from the dropdown menu
        6. Choose the cs225-remote server that you tried to connect to before in steps 1-3

2) if you are getting a new error, along the lines of ""Unable to connect"" and you were previously able to connect you may need to delete a directory on EWS that is auto populated by VS Codes SSH extension. Connect to EWS in a terminal, enter `rm -rf .vscode-server/` in your home directory to delete the `.vscode-server/` directory, try and connect again with VSC's SSH extension.

"669663536955260957","Muds#3854","06-Mar-21 11:54 PM","Ooo good question. Generally, the order of arguments don't matter. However, its always a good idea to run `$ man {name_of_function}` to see if that particular software requires commands in a particular order. Now, the man page for `clang` doesn't give any info on the ordering of arguments, so its okay to place them any way (i think???). In any case, according to the `gcc` (GNU's alternative to `clang`) man page:
>        You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
>        order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use
>        several options of the same kind; for example, if you specify -L
>        more than once, the directories are searched in the order
>        specified.  Also, the placement of the -l option is significant.
From [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html) (under ""Description"")

So unless we're linking a library (using  the `-l`/`-L` flag), we're good to order the arguments in any way.","",""

So far, we have been building and improving a system that enables us to predict if a dog is seeing a treat!
We have 4 different teams:
Mechanical Design:  This team has built a custom-made harness that we use to collect data from the dog‚Äôs brains.
Electrical Engineering: This team has built a non-intrusive PCB that enables us to process the electrical signals emitted by the dog‚Äôs brain.
Software Development: This team has built the data collection and machine learning algorithms that enable us to make predictions!
Animal Interactions: This team works to ensure that we always use best practices as we develop our methods.
We are having our first information session on Thursday, September 9 at 7:00pm CT. We‚Äôd love for you to join. If you‚Äôre interested in joining our info session, please register through this form!

They did this by exploiting a couple of different data structures (one of which is a (2,3) tree, a variant of which is used in one of your upcoming lab/mps) and by choosing efficient design decisions (which is a big component of making mp_mazes run quickly). This is a really great example of why worrying about different data structures and examining the runtime order of certain design decisions can have insanely huge impacts! https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/09/29/bracket-pair-colorization","","üëÄ (3),‚¨ÜÔ∏è (1),pog (3)"

Since the priority queue, in this case is an array, is shuffled around, if we want to change a specific distance of a node, we have to go through the array and find the node and change the distance, which means updating the distance will cost O(n). I thought about keeping track of how things are shuffled around using a map that maps a node to an index in the array, which means I can find the index easily, but now everytime something is shuffeld around, it has to be updated too, which cost O(log(n)) everytime. I'm having an idea of only pushing the weight into the priorityQueue while work out what node it is outside of the queue but I haven't try it yet.

I'm thinking that we just run BFS on every vertex that hasn't been visited before, and then increment the number of weakly connected components by 1
But this example is confusing me:
If we happen to run BFS on node 0 before node 5, then we will be fine and we'll traverse the whole component and count it as 1
But if we happen to run BFS on 5 before 0, then we'll count {5} as one WCC, and then {0,2,4} as another WCC, which seems wrong","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/691757656813338736/919382779211436032/unknown.png",""
