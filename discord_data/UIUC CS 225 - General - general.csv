If we didn't stop to talk about everyone's questions, we could cover much more. This felt more like office hours than a lecture.

First when you declare variables in functions you get the memory to store them as long as the function is running. This memory is stored on the stack. When you return from a function you give up that memory.

is it ethical and/or permitted to share test cases with other students? my intuition says no to ethical, but maybe to permitted -- it's not clear to me in the student code

§ 1‑402a mentions 
> Instructors are strongly encouraged to make in advance a clear statement of their policies and procedures concerning the use of shared study aids, examination files, and related materials and forms of assistance
§ 1‑402a.1 mentions
> Allowing others to conduct research or prepare any work for a student without prior authorization from the Instructor, including using the services of commercial term paper companies.
my intuition says *maybe* it's ""legal"", because test cases are not submitted for a grade -- but it could be considered an unauthorized study aid, perhaps...

do the instructors have a stance on this?
*disclaimer, this is a hypothetical question, of course. i'd just like to have a greater understanding of what professors at UIUC consider as academic integrity violation, so i can stay as *far* away from that as possible :)","",""

The correct answer is O(1), but I thought it would be O(n), because after deletion, don't you need shift the locations of values down one to get rid of the deleted space? This would possible move n items.","",""

@LLucky  no, the definition of a complete tree is that it’s a perfect tree with possibly the exception of its last level where all the leaves are leaning towards the left. If it was a perfect tree with 15 nodes the tree’s height would only be 3. In that question you need a height of 4 so you’d have to add one more node making the answer 16","","👍 (1)"

@Epsilon So you Enqueue and the Dequeue, and after dequeue you enqueue that nodes children, going in a level order way. In a tree b-a-c( a is root) you would enqueue dequeue ""a"" and then move on to its children, so enqueue ""b"" and then ""c"" and then dequeue ""b"" and c"" in that order.","","👍 (1)"

For this question, they're asking us to remove an element from the end of the list. 
To do this in O(1) time, we need to be able to access
(1) The final element (to remove it) 
(2) The element before it (to set it's next pointer equal to NULL) without having to traverse through the list at all. 
Out of all the options, only IV gives us access to the final element (tail) and the element before it (tail->prev) without having to traverse through the list, hence (a) is correct.
You should also know the difference between a singly-linked list and a doubly-linked list. A singly-linked list has a next pointer while a doubly-linked list has a next pointer and a prev pointer.","","👍 (1)"

Think of it this way the run time for remove and find are bound by the length of the chains. The length of the chains are bound by how many different numbers hash to the same value. SUHA can be interpreted as saying that the chance that any particular key is inserted at a particular index is (1/N) so if you insert n things in to the table the expected number of items at any index is n/N so that gives a runtime of O(n/N).","","🙌 (1)"

Well since the running time is O(n/N) if we can hold n/N under some constant then we can show that the run time is constant. To do this all we need to do is expand the array anytime the load factor would increase above the what ever constant you are keeping it under. So the final part of the picture is that you need to show that the runtime is still constant when the array is expanded. That proof would look much like what we did with the the array list.","","👏 (1)"

@growthmindset this is something that irks me about the CS department. I understand the priority system and all but the way that they go about it sucks.

union(H,D), union(C,D), union(A,B), union(H,E), union(E,B), union(C,B), union(E,A)
The way I do this is strictly visual so this will be wordy to try to explain but, step by step, 
1.  D -> H
2. D has root H, H has size 2 which is greater than C which points to nothing. C -> H
3. B -> A
4. E -> H
5. E has root H, H has size 3. B has root A, A has size 2. Bigger size wins, root of B points to root of E (A -> H)
6. Both C and B point to H, so normally nothing would happen BUT since this has path compression and when we find(B) it recurses up to its root, we set B to point to its root, so now B -> H
7. E and A point to the same root so nothing happens
Now you can write out A B C D E F G H I J and write down what each points to. If root, since we are doing union by size, the value is -1 minus # of nodes pointing at the root, so H will be -6
A, B, C, D, E will all have value of H (7) and the rest will be -1","",""

        2. Enter `YourNetID@cs225-remote.ews.illinois.edu` and press enter. Enter your password if needed
        3. This will probably not work, so open the VSCode command palette (View --> Command Palette) at the top
        4. Type `remote` in to the box, but do not press enter yet
        5. Select `Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host` from the dropdown menu

1) if you follow the EngrIT instruction, the config they provide does not have a `User` parameter, so the connection infers your netid based on your local PCs name.. as you can imagine, this is wrong. There is discussion in the Piazza post that shows how to properly add the `User` property

2) if you are getting a new error, along the lines of ""Unable to connect"" and you were previously able to connect you may need to delete a directory on EWS that is auto populated by VS Codes SSH extension. Connect to EWS in a terminal, enter `rm -rf .vscode-server/` in your home directory to delete the `.vscode-server/` directory, try and connect again with VSC's SSH extension.

The thing with average is it has to be talking about some data set (possibly infinite ) and this is not quite as strong a bound as amortized. The difference is consider with dice the average roll of a fair six sided die is 3.5 but if I roll it 10 times I don't know that I will get a value of 35. And even if I put a big-O on it that does not get me there since there is no fixed k I can pick such that the dice rolls will allways stay below. That is not true in amortized.","",""

However, its always a good idea to run `$ man {name_of_function}` to see if that particular software requires commands in a particular order. Now, the man page for `clang` doesn't give any info on the ordering of arguments, so its okay to place them any way (i think???). In any case, according to the `gcc` (GNU's alternative to `clang`) man page:
>        You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
>        order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use
>        several options of the same kind; for example, if you specify -L

>        specified.  Also, the placement of the -l option is significant.
From [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html) (under ""Description"")

So unless we're linking a library (using  the `-l`/`-L` flag), we're good to order the arguments in any way.","",""

a lot of the course is actually doing zeroth order (if this then that, this and not that, etc.) and first order proofs (all x are y, there exists x such that y, etc.), and also proof touching upon set theory, which can be applied to a lot of different kinds of proofs (it made MATH213 proofs easier to understand, the first half of CS374 was manageable)

A best case for the height of this BTree would be log64(317,814,000); roughly 5.

no matter where you stand at the end of this semester you all deserve a great pat on the back. good job everyone 🥳  may your future algorithms and data structures be O(1)~","","❤️ (28),unoreverse (14),✌️ (11)"

The worst that can happen is that you don’t get the spot, but there is a lot of potential upside. Also from what I recall about the interview process, they aren’t concerned as much about hiring a certain amount of people as whether they think you would be a good fit. Probably since this class has a large enrollment size, more people are bound to apply, which means potentially it is more selective than classes with fewer people enrolled, but that imo doesn’t matter all that much; on the other hand, larger class means more staff so maybe it balances out in the end.","",""

So far, we have been building and improving a system that enables us to predict if a dog is seeing a treat!
We have 4 different teams:
Mechanical Design:  This team has built a custom-made harness that we use to collect data from the dog’s brains.
Electrical Engineering: This team has built a non-intrusive PCB that enables us to process the electrical signals emitted by the dog’s brain.
Software Development: This team has built the data collection and machine learning algorithms that enable us to make predictions!
Animal Interactions: This team works to ensure that we always use best practices as we develop our methods.
We are having our first information session on Thursday, September 9 at 7:00pm CT. We’d love for you to join. If you’re interested in joining our info session, please register through this form!

The code below shows how an array resizes when it is full. Note that variable size is the size of the array and count is the number of elements in the stack.

Which statement is true about this array?

Since the priority queue, in this case is an array, is shuffled around, if we want to change a specific distance of a node, we have to go through the array and find the node and change the distance, which means updating the distance will cost O(n). I thought about keeping track of how things are shuffled around using a map that maps a node to an index in the array, which means I can find the index easily, but now everytime something is shuffeld around, it has to be updated too, which cost O(log(n)) everytime.

I'm thinking that we just run BFS on every vertex that hasn't been visited before, and then increment the number of weakly connected components by 1
But this example is confusing me:
If we happen to run BFS on node 0 before node 5, then we will be fine and we'll traverse the whole component and count it as 1
But if we happen to run BFS on 5 before 0, then we'll count {5} as one WCC, and then {0,2,4} as another WCC, which seems wrong","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/691757656813338736/919382779211436032/unknown.png",""

If you use an unsigned, all 4 bits would be used for representing the number.

So with an unsigned 4-bit integer you'd have a range of 0 to 2^4 - 1, whereas with signed you'd only have -2^3 to 2^3 - 1 which is a waste if you only want to store positive numbers
