This is some debugging output from my lab, where I print the address of each Room object and associated letters array as it gets deleted.
For some reason, I get an Invalid pointer error when doing this, but only on the 5th room and letter array (Siebel 1105). This happens on EWS as well, though weirdly not when run in Valgrind.

I've got literally no idea why this would work for the first 4 rooms and then fail on the 5th, when there's nothing special about this room in particular.

In C/C++ you go row by row so if you have an array that is 10x10 to get to array[x][y] you go to  10*y*size + y* size from the start address and there you go. This can be extended and any dimension as long as you know the size of the array. In general this is how we want to represent arrays but many languages have nice extensions to make them more usable.

Large amounts of comments are in fact often counter productive since they tend not to get updated as the code changes and then are actually worse than no comments. The key is if there is something tricky that has to work in a non-obvious way it is worth noting what is happening with a comment. It is also often worth commenting the interface of functions in the header file so you can tell how to use them but in general we have provided those comments.","",""

1: Install VSCode
2: Install Remote - SSH extension
3: Install University VPN https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn/download-and-set-up-the-vpn-client
4: Once VPN is installed, boot it up, connect to `vpn.illinois.edu` and login with your netID and password
5: Once the VPN is connected, go to VSCode and hit `ctrl+shift+p` to open the search bar at the top. Type in `Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host...` and hit enter or click on the option.
6: It will ask you to put in a server. Put in `NETID@linux.ews.illinois.edu` while changing NETID to your netID.
7: There will be a couple of prompts to go through. Pick your folder, click okay, etc.
8: Once that is done, it should ask you to connect in the bottom right. It's a little glitchy. If it doesn't do anything, go to the left part of the window. There will be a new tab called `Remote Explorer` with the server in it. You'll want to then click the connect button (little screen with a + sign on it).
9: You'll then need to log in.

Once you connect, you can open a folder from the remote connection. You can also access the terminal by typing `ctrl+` ` (that's ctrl + backtick). Once you're in the console. You can follow all of the instructions in the labs and resources to setup your git and lab.","","üôè (3)"
