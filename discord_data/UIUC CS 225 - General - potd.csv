@gcevans Wouldn't the 36 hours disadvantage some students more than others? If it were 24, regardless of when it comes out, you have one working day to get it done (it's just a matter of when it comes out for you). Whereas with 36, if it releases at midnight Champaign time, champaign students only receive an extra 4 hours working time (*assuming* they wake up and start working on it by 8am).

What would happen if we just normally passed a Node *head representing the head of the linked list into the function? We could still alter the node that head points to. But what if we want to change the head pointer itself? E.g., what if we wanted to insert a new node into the front of the list? If we just called the function like this: insertSorted(head, newNode) where head is a Node *, then the memory address stored in the pointer is copied into the function. The function can change the pointer, but this will only change the copy of the pointer, not the pointer that lives outside the function. To change the address stored in the pointer we need to pass by pointer. The function call would then look like: insertNode(&head, Node). We also could have passed the pointer by reference, though we would have to change the function signature to be: insertSorted(Node * & head, Node * n).","",""

But after `insertSorted(out, first->data_)` returns and I used `print(out)`, I get an empty list.

Inductive hypothesis:
A binary selection with n - 1 uncertainties requires n submissions to determine correctness, and submit, and n - 1 submissions to determine the correct answer.

Inductive step:
A binary selection with n uncertainties can be split into t sections of N length (t = (ceil N/n) - 1), where n - N is the number of correct answers on a submission of all 0. There then remains one section with a length <= N. Based on our inductive hypothesis, each section requires exactly N submissions to determine the correct solution, with the last requiring N - 1. Thus, the initial submission (s = 1), t submissions, to break each section down, (s = t + 1) each section requiring N - 1 to determine correctness, (s = t + 1 + (t+1)(N-1)) and n - tN -1 for the last section, and one to submit the correct answer.
