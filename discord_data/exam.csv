In other words, O(8) is always your run time. Formally, O(8) = O(1) since they're both constant terms.

In a singly linked list (meaning you can't progress backwards from a tail node), the size of your problem is scaled by the size of your list. Every single time you find the 8th node from the end, you have to traverse through n - 8 nodes since you can't start from the back, meaning that the total number of nodes you have to traverse is variable. This means that you have O(n) runtime since your runtime scales linearly by the size of your linked list.","","üëç (1)"

Definition of Connected Component (1):
If there exists a path from vertex A to B, then A and B are part of the same connected components

Definition of Path (2):
A path is a walk that does not repeat vertices

find is where path compression happens as described in the disjoint set page of the mp_mazes, it recursively pushes x and everything above x to be the child of the root node, and returns the root node. The value in the root nodes is either the rank or size, which is what is compared when combining.
