The difference between DFS and BFS is in the data structure that is maintaining the elements to work on. So you need to write ++ to work that way using data stored in your iterator.","",""

You need a way to check that everything is in the same disjoint set.

> and what if you keep randomly selecting already deleted walls
So this is slightly more complicated than it sounds, especially when you're trusting probability and hoping that everything works out.
A useful thing to know about is the coupon collector problem (this is not the exact analysis we need, but close enough). It says that if you have N coupons that you're equally likely to see at any given time, then on average it will take you O(N log N) time steps to see all coupons. 
Proof (wikipedia, if you're comfortable with probability, o/w you can believe it for now until you've taken a few prob classes): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem#Calculating_the_expectation 
Also, being a certain thing on average is actually not so bad. The wiki also has those two ""concentration inequalities"" that show that the probability you take longer than c times the average is < 1/c, and for this problem that the probability that you exceed it in linear skips is < pi^2/(6c^2) (pi^2/6 is a famous constant ..). But basically the behavior you'd expect to see if you don't mind revisiting things is n log n. 
You *can* shuffle the walls you'd pick beforehand uniformly randomly, and then do your deletion thing in linear time. You might want to think about how to produce random shuffles (there are a bunch of ways to do that, but see maybe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher–Yates_shuffle)","",""

Now consider the linking file `$(EXENAME) : output_msg $(OBJS)` this expands to `lab_intro : output_msg main.o PNG.o HSLAPixel.o lodepng.o lab_intro.o` which says that to link the executable the .o files need to have been built.  So you get a build tree with lab_intro at the root which first needs to build all the .o files and to do that will check the dependancies of each of those so in the case of main.o it will check if any of main.cpp lab_intro.h cs225/PNG.h cs225/HSLAPixel.h have changed since main.o was built and if they have will rebuild main.o.

One is to make 2 lists. One stores the x coordinate of the image and the other list stores the y coordinate.

I think this may be difficult to manage all these lists, and I am not too fond of this approach.

Another method I was considering will be easier, but I am not sure if it is allowed. I would make another class called Sticker which stores an Image, an x coordinate, and y coordinate. The array of stickers in the StickerSheet class would then just be an array of the new class Stickers.
